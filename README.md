## Abstract

__GenRel-World is a general Reinforcement Learning framework for handling various world models as environments for robotic arm manipulation.__

## Bases

The framework involves reinforcement learning concepts from [0] and meta-reinforcement learning and multi-task learning using the Meta-World open-source simulated benchmark [1].
The project utilizes Google DeepMinds's MuJoCo (Multi-Joint dynamics with Contact) as a general purpose physics engine that aims to facilitate research and development in robotics. [2].
To simulate our 7 degree of freedom robotic arm we use MuJoCo Menagerie as a collection of high-quality models for the MuJoCo physics engine, curated by Google DeepMind [3].
We share the dream of Yann LeCun about how to construct autonomous intelligent agents [4].
